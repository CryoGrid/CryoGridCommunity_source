# CryoGrid Community Model

This is the community version of *CryoGrid*, a numerical model to investigate land surface processes in permafrost environments. This version of *CryoGrid* is implemented in MATLAB.

*Note: This is the latest major version of the CryoGrid model family. It comprises the functionalities of previous versions including [CryoGrid3](https://github.com/CryoGrid/CryoGrid3), which we no longer encourage to be used.*

## Documentation

The documentation of *CryoGrid* is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://cryogrid-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Some parts of the documentation have yet to be incorporated into ReadTheDocs and are currently provided in a separate [PDF](./doc/CryoGrid_documentation.pdf).

## Getting started

In order to run *CryoGrid*, additional user-adjustable files need to be obtained from the repository [CryoGridExamples](https://github.com/CryoGrid/CryoGridExamples). See [this section](https://cryogrid-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/Quick%20start.html#get-started-getting-code-and-examples-for-running-your-first-model) in the documentation for detailed instructions on how to set up the model code and how to run first simulations.
