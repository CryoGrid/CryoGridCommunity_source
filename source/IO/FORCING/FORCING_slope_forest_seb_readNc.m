% CryoGrid FORCING class FORCING_slope_seb
% simple model forcing for GROUND classes computing the surface energy balance 
% (keyword “seb”). The data must be stored in a Matlab “.mat” file which contains 
% a struct FORCING with field “data”, which contain the time series of the actual 
% forcing data, e.g. FORCING.data.Tair contains the time series of air temperatures. 
% Have a look at the existing forcing files in the folder “forcing” and prepare 
% new forcing files in the same way. The mandatory forcing variables are air temperature 
% (Tair, in degree Celsius), incoming long-wave radiation (Lin, in W/m2), 
% incoming short-.wave radiation (Sin, in W/m2), absolute humidity (q, in 
% kg water vapor / kg air), wind speed (wind, in m/sec), rainfall (rainfall, in mm/day), 
% snowfall (snowfall, in mm/day) and timestamp (t_span, 
% in Matlab time / increment 1 corresponds to one day). 
% IMPORTANT POINT: the time series must be equally spaced in time, and this must be 
% really exact. When reading the timestamps from an existing data set (e.g. an Excel file),
% rounding errors can result in small differences in the forcing timestep, often less 
% than a second off. In this case, it is better to manually compile a new, equally spaced 
% timestep in Matlab.
% S. Westermann, T. Ingeman-Nielsen, J. Scheer, October 2020
% Edited (changes for slopes) were made by J. Schmidt, December 2020
% The forcing data need in addition for the slope:
%       S_TOA: Short-wave radiation at the top of the atmosphere
%       albedo_foot: albedo at the foot of the slope (can vary in time for
%           example with a snow layer
%   Not-mandatory (just applicable if there is a water body at the foot of
%   the slope):
%       seaT: seawater temperature
%       seaIce: 0 = time steps without sea ice; 1 = time steps with sea ice
