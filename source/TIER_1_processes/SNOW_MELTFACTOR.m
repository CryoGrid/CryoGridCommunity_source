% CryoGrid TIER1 library class for functions related to snow cover
% melting using simple melt factor.
%
% The melt factor is in the range of observed values (2-12 mmSWE/day) and 
% scaled by the length of day and maximum sun angle (derived from the date
% and the latitude).
% The melt rate is then given by the product of the melt factor and the air
% temperature in given time step.
% Knowing the melt rate, the energy needed to obtain this melt rate within 
% the current timestep is calculated based on the temperature and density 
% of the uppermost snow cell, and timestep is chosen such that within the
% timestep no more than half of a cell is melted.
